(1) quick setup ec2 instance on aws
    create new role (personal-site)
    download pem, move to ssh folder
    chmod 400 personal-site-admin.pem
    make sure http https and ssh into instance

(2) ssh into ec2 instance 
    ssh -i "personal-site-admin.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-205-206-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com

(3) install nginx 
        sudo amazon-linux-extras list | grep nginx
        sudo amazon-linux-extras enable nginx1D
        sudo yum clean metadata
        sudo yum -y install nginx

        which nginx -> get the path to binary
        nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -> test nginx config
        nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -> start nginx with given config
        netstat -pltn | grep nginx -> see on which ports nginx is listening 

        try and start nginx 
        sudo systemctl start nginx.service

        or check status: 
        sudo systemctl status nginx

        if get error: 
        nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)

        then see what's on that port:
        sudo netstat -tulpn
        nginx may already be running. 

        had to end process 
        sudo fuser -k 80/tcp

        this finally worked 
        sudo systemctl restart nginx
        
(4) to see if you can connect to nginx server
    curl localhost 
    or enter Public IPv4 address into browser

(5) install git
    sudo yum install git
    sudo git clone https://github.com/cdialpha/personal-site-spa.git

(6) Need to install nodejs to install dependencies. Follow tut on aws: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html
    (a) curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
    (b) . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    (c) nvm install --lts 
        // this worked when I was in the ec2-
    (d) two detour steps? 
            nvm use --delete-prefix v18.0.0
            had to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72022527/glibc-2-27-not-found-while-installing-node-on-amazon-ec2-instance
            Try installing the active LTS version instead of latest with 'nvm install 16' (instead of nvm install node) as per the examples. 
    (e) node -e "console.log('Running Node.js ' + process.version)"
   

(7) run npm install
    initially i got an access-denied error. 
    followed this SO thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48798760/npm-install-on-aws-ec2-instance-throw-eacces

(8) build in directory with json.config
    npm run build 
    pwd to get html within build directory eg. /home/ec2-user/app-deploy/personal-site-spa/dist/index.html

(9) cd into ~/etc/nginx/
    nano nginx.config

    change root to "/home/ec2-user/app-deploy/personal-site-spa/dist"
    just below, add location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html
    } 
    optional: make second file /etc/nginx/conf.d/react.conf  then cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf 

    run config test "sudo nginx -t" 
    if successful then tell nginx to reload "sudo service nginx reload"

    several options for where you store your build files. 
    in the home directory I have ec2-user. There I created an app-deploy folder. 
    that's where I built in step (8) 
    Was giving me trouble so I moved the build folder to var/www
