quick setup ec2 instance on aws
    create new role (personal-site)
    download pem, move to ssh folder

ssh into ec2 instance 

install nginx 
        sudo amazon-linux-extras list | grep nginx
        sudo amazon-linux-extras enable nginx1D
        sudo yum clean metadata
        sudo yum -y install nginx

which nginx -> get the path to binary
nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -> test nginx config
nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -> start nginx with given config
netstat -pltn | grep nginx -> see on which ports nginx is listening 

try and start nginx 
    sudo systemctl start nginx.service

or check status: 
    sudo systemctl status nginx
    
if get error: 
    nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)

then see what's on that port:
    sudo netstat -tulpn
    nginx may already be running. 

had to end process 
    sudo fuser -k 80/tcp

this finally worked 
     sudo systemctl restart nginx

if you want to
    curl localhost
